EzRPG Rework Revisited
======================

Unofficial TESTING!!
====================

Welcome to my attempt at trying to combine the features of Swiftlet (a minimalistic MVC framework swiftlet.org) and ezRPG Engine to test the future possibilities for the ezRPG series.

Currently nothing is fully made other than the frame work and standard user-submited Auth, PDO, and Session packages.

Later I'll start adding basic model and views to create a very basic base for the ezRPG Engine.

To install simply set the config.php db settings to match your server. Personally I use the ezRPG tables already installed so I can mimic their functionality before we start gutting new features.

This repo is set to private now, as it's unstable and not meant to be used or mistaken for an official production of ezRPG.
